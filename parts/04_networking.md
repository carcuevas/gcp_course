## Routing

* This is useful :D https://www.webopedia.com/reference/osi-layers/

* It's not about any particular routing scheme nor setting the stage for routing tables / routes
* We are calling it Routing because this is about Networking in general it is about the **Data Flow** perspective, it is how each peace of data is going from place to place.
* So routing in the sense: *Where data should go next?*


### Routing to Google's Network (Premium Routing Tier)

* Google claims, that the routing of data is done mostly in Google's network that's why they have control and it is faster.
* Total exposure of the data in internet is much smaller
* In the *Standard Routing* they suppose to know where the data have to go before going inside the Google network.  So if we have a web in California, the user has to route the data all the way to California where then get to the webserver. But when using *Premium Routing* when the request goes to the Google Point of Presence, they can decide what location is best to send it, or even if another place may be better. One can have different copies in different places.


### Routing to the right resource (Load Balancing)
This is important because of: 
* Latency reduction (servers physically close to clients)

* Load Balancing
  * Separate from auto-scaling

* System design
