my notes from the course

## Basics

### GCP Design Principles
* It's **GLOBAL**  
  As example, AWS is highly regional which simplifies the data sovereignity, but GCP is global, so it's easier to handle failures and latency; but it could be more sensitive to multi-region/global failures
* IT's **Secure**
* It's **Huge Scale**
* It's for **Developers**


### Physical infrastructure
* vCPU
* Physical Server
* Rack
* DAta Center Building
* Zone (trying to be as much independent as other zone as possible)
* Region
* Multi-Region
* Private-Global-networks (not using internet to communicate between them)
* Points of Presence (POPs) Network edges and CDNs locations
* Global
